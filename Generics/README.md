## Sample code on base of Generics

**Generic** allows to make class,method, interface to reusable (i.e., avoid code duplicate), functionality perform well as expected if we pass same type of values during execution. It fails during compilation whichs avoids type face run time issue.

**Apply Generics on **
1. Classes
2. Methods
3. Interfaces

**Scenario: Problems with Value to Object approach**
1. Type safety issue
2. Boxing and unboxing

**Scenario: Problems with Copy and paste for each type**
1. No code reusable
2. Duplicate of same set of logic

**Scenario to go Generics:**
1. No boxing and un boxing => Value to Object (Boxing) and Object to Value (Unboxing)
2. No type saftey issue.
