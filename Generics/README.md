## Sample code on base of Generics

**Generic** allows to make class,method, interface to reusable (i.e., avoid code duplicate), functionality perform well as expected if we pass same type of values during execution. It fails during compilation whichs avoids type face run time issue.

**Apply Generics on **
1. Classes
2. Methods
3. Interfaces


**Scenario to go Generics:**
1. No boxing and un boxing => Value to Object (Boxing) and Object to Value (Unboxing)
2. No type face issue.
