## Sample code on base of Generics

**Generic** allows to make class,method, interface to reusable (i.e., avoid code duplicate), functionality perform well as expected if we pass any type of values.

**Apply Generics on **
1. Classes
2. Methods
3. Interfaces


**Scenario to go Generics:**
1. No boxing and un boxing => Value to Object (Boxing) and Object to Value (Unboxing)
2. No type face issue.
